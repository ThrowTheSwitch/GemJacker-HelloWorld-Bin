= gemjacker-helloworld-bin

An example program showing how to ship an executable and hook it into the
GemJacker system.

Take a look at example/rake_test.rb to see how to invoke the GemJacker
system and how to call the binary.

NOTE: The binary is not included in the repository. Building it requies that
GCC be in your path. Build it with the following command:

> rake build_executable
